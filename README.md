Scroll wheel code for Logitech Marble Trackball

Based on code originally by Burdu (https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/issues/814#issuecomment-415388742). 

The code has been modified to support scrolling for the Logitech Marble Trackball when either the back or forward (mouse 3 or mouse 4) is held down.
